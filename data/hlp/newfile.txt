 The new file options are:

   - <b>Path to data file</b>

   - <b>Week range</b> is from <b>Date1</b> to <b>Date2</b>;
     "[" means "included", ")" means "excluded";
     Date1 < Date2 <= Date1 + 53 weeks

 The <b>path to data file</b> is cloned from the current file name.

 Also, by default

   - <b>Date1</b> is taken from the last week of the current file

   - <b>Date2</b> is equal to "Date1 + 53 weeks"
